# Welcome to Vincent's GitHub profile 

Hi, I am a PhD student at IRIF. My research topics lie at the interface between mathematics and computer science. More precisely, I work on Î»-calculus, semantics of programming languages, type theory, logic and a lot of other subjects that I try to understand categorically.

I also enjoy coding during my free time, especially implementations of theoretical structures. I program in a lot of different languages, ranging from the well-known languages like C and Python to proof assistants like Coq and Agda. I tend to think that computer scientists, no matter how pure their research, always benefit from knowing all the programming paradigms that exist, including the more applied ones. This profile is an effort in that direction.
